HUMAN RESOURCES MANAGEMENT
Session 1: Human Resources and Management
I. Origins of Human Resource Management
Until the 19th century: working on their own, economic were around independent work, no
need for coordinating all these people
- Economic activities are structured around independent work
- Trading is based upon using services of independent craftsperson or farmer
- No need for coordination and individuals are doing business on their own
Since 1830: Industrial Revolution:
- New technologies and energy sources lead to industrial concentration in urban areas
- Need for people at the same place for given position in firms
- Need for planning, organizing, staffing (recruit for a given position), leading, and
controlling
First needs identified in “Personnel Management”: Staffing and Disciplinary measures
Before Industrial Management After Indutrial Management
Autonomy No autonomy
Self-Management No Self-Management
Flexible work hours Inflexible work hours
Work at home in small groups Commute to large, noisy workplace
Household income Individual income
II. Understanding the strategic role of HRM
A. HR FUNCTION: PERSONEL DEPARTMENT
Between 1880 and 1900: Bad condition, so they start to protest = creation of recruitment
manager
- Recruitment
- People allocation
Before WWI:
- First protest actions and strikes lead to the function of “Recruitment Manager” whose
role was to hire people without political engagement by discriminating trade unionist
After WWII:
- Labor shortage, child labor (abolished in 1882 – Jules Ferry Law)
- Issues in recruiting and retaining people in companies
- Generalization of Personnel department in big firms
B. HR FUNCTION: LABOUR RELATIONS
(Still protesting because bad conditions they wanted a more friendly supervision)
Before WWII:
- Increasing protest actions and bad human conditions at work lead to manage people
in a “friendly supervision”
- Understanding of the needs of negotiations and labor relations
Personnel department is no more reduced to staffing and controlling but is enlarged to labor
relations
Birth of labor agreement and intensification of labor regulations
C. COMPENSATION & BENEFITS
After WWII:
- Economy is rising thanks to Fordism (Automatization)
Automatization and rationalization of work “temps modern movie”, plenty of
employees, high rate of trade union members so came the need of equity and fair
treatment
- Mass production leads to standardization of productivity gain
- Firms have many employees and high rate of trade union members
- Need to bring equity and fair treatment in the workplace especially wages and salaries
are concerned (first need staffing and control after compensation and benefits)
- Wages and salaries are determined by education degree, seniority and career position
Personnel department enlarges its activities to “compensation and benefits”
D. HR FUNCTION: RATIONALIZATION
Rationalization of personnel is characterized by:
- A strong centralization which allows companies to:
o uniformed personnel management within the firm
o encourage labor relations
o respect fair treatment
- A specialization of the function which leads to separate activities:
o Compensation and benefits services
o Recruitment
o Labor relations
o Training, etc.
E. HR FUNCTION: LEGITIMACY
Early 80’s consequences of the first oil shock and globalization:
Firing people because they were doing a single task, and global crisis, firing people, instead of
having a lot of people in a same task: skill and performance
- International competitiveness decreases market share and companies’ performance
- Decline of mass production model and large dismissal for economic reasons
(redundancy)
- Necessity to have valuable workers to keep surviving in a tough economy with people
involved in conceiving, planning, organizing, and controlling their work
- Focus on skills and competencies over workforce quantity
From Personnel Department to Human Resource Department
In the 80’s, the staffing costs penalizes firms. HR need to demonstrate the ROI of wages.
Focus on skill to have a competitive advantage
New school of thought: consider employees as resources and no more as costs
F. STRATEGIC HUMAN RESOURCES MANAGEMENT
Until 1980’s:
- Employees are considered as workforce dedicated to firms
- After corporate strategy is defined, HR department only must follow it by
implementing training for employees (was not of the structure)
Since 1990’s:
- Companies realize that technical and human resources can make strategy more
efficient (sustainable and reliable)
- HR department is integrated into corporate strategy
Since 2000’s:
- Human capital is considered as an asset and represents a competitive advantage which
has to be carefully supported and developed (HC: skill experiences, knowledge that
they bring to the company)
G. CHALLENGES IN STRATEGIC HRM
Obligation of making profit: The massive part of stock exchange requires to clear profit of all
activities to pay dividend to stockholders
HR department is under the pressure of making profit and adding value to the firm.
Short term effects (adapting the strategy):
- Layoff
- Externalization of law value activities ...
Long term effects:
- Training
- Change management
- Mergers & Acquisitions
- Prospective (forecast)
- Challenging or changing jobs
Which major events have influenced the evolution of Human Resource Management?
- Protestation and strikes
- Fordism
- Bad condition so labor revolution “first protestation”
- Oil shocks
- Industrial revolution
- WWI
- WWII
III. Understanding the role of HR Managers
A. DEFINITIONS & CHARACTERISTICS OF HRM
HRM: strategy, skill to be competitive on the other hand people expectations holding kill and
diploma, it’s a match with expectation and skill, having the right person un the right place in
the organization
“HRM includes all decisions and actions related to the relationship between employees and
their company.” Retaining people
“HRM is a managerial approach which consists in creating and maintaining a competitive
advantage by hiring and developing highly competent and committed people.”
Human resource management is MULTIDISCIPLINARY:
- Law: plenty on obligation and issue in HRM
- Psychology
- Sociology
- Economy: after oil shock, firing people
- Management: human management
Strategic (ex. consulting the CEO)
Innovative (ex. gamification of recruitment)
Individual and collective (ex. salary & collective bonuses) dealing with humans or work with
an all department
Qualitative and quantitative (ex. life quality at work vs. number of sick leaves) life balance or
number of sick leaves or absences
Short, mid-term and long term oriented (ex. training, talent management)
Corporate and social values keeper (ex. value-driven-recruitment) recruit who match cultural,
technical skill is easier to work so values that can match its more important, likely to stay
longer in the organization, maintain a certain culture
Turnover in HR: means people leave and you have to recruit again and again
Internal promotion: when you are promoted, going up in the hierarchy
CLASS EXERCISE
Ex: Private software solutions company that employs 380 people has lately seen a decrease in
turnover of 10%, a 10% increase in internal promotion rates, a 15% drop on several
employees who leave the company in their first year.
1. How can you interpret the numbers?
2. What could have happened?
3. CHALLENGES OF HR FUNCTION
Good, a lot of people have stayed, stability in organization, means that people are staying
more than 1 year, integrating process is good, they are feeling well inside, if internal rates
increase more people are being promoted, they are skilled enough and performing well and
give them opportunities of advancement, they can evolve, so its why they are staying because
they can evolve. They want to stay if they can evolve, and because of the life of the
organization. We can promote people internally, so there is qualitative and quantitative
dimension. Companies adapt with the new expectation of the new generation: increase
competitiveness. Picture with a vision of the strategy and the other hand people who have
expectation about life, match between strategy and expectation, this is the role of the HRM,
to have the good people in the right place.
B. CHALLENGES OF HR FUNCTION
HR faces many challenges such as:
- Technological evolution pandemic how to recruit differently
- Increased Competitiveness hire more talented candidate, fighting for the best
- Globalization sending someone abroad
- Economic Uncertainty how to react to economic context
- Diversity and Demographical Evolutions showing how employees are adapted to the
generation, get adapted to demo evolution
- Labor Relations (Industrial Relations) personal data protection, like with the resume
- Constantly Changing Laws and Regulations
5 major roles of HR managers:
1. Change agent: before mix organization they were two departments, so it has to change
organization, supporting change, hiring new profile, interest about organization and
the employee, they had to maintain a certain training
2. Strategic partner: employee needs, employability, maintain a certain level for
competitive advantage or internal with the leaving
3. Employee advocate: forecasting training recruit

D. HR MANAGERS ARE NOT ALMIGHTY
Not always an HR department, they can be taking over by the management, for money can be
financial management, even when rh are focus on strategy matters, profile to recruit or
training, so rely to management for certain activities
- HR Managers have to deal with many activities and constraints. Thus, HR managers
aim to focus more on HR strategy and less on HR daily activities.
- When there are people there have to be HR activities, however HR managers cannot
deal with every specific issue of every person.
- Small and medium companies do not always have a HR department even if there is a
need for Human Resource Management.
Because HRM managers are not almighty, (team) managers have to take over some HR
activities.
E. WHO IS A TEAM MANAGER?
- A person who leads a group/team in a given context to reach a set of objectives.
- A (team) manager deploys corporate strategy at the level of their team, organizes the
workflow and the activities within their service or department.

activity, understands the needs in terms of skills and competencies by being in direct
contact with team members and collects formal and informal information.

MNC is considered to have several businesses in different countries but managed from the
headquarters, located in one country.”
